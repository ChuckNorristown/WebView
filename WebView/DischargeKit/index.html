                                        <p>Take BRILINTA and aspirin exactly as instructed by your doctor. You should not take a dose of aspirin higher than 100 mg daily because it can affect how well BRILINTA works. Tell your doctor if you take other medicines that contain aspirin.

                                <p class="bull-align bold"><span class="bull-grey">&bull;</span>Bleeding will also take longer than usual to stop.</p>
